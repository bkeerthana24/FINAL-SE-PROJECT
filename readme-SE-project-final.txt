#Research Questions
- 1. What types of quality issues (for example, as identified by linters) are common in the 
code generated by ChatGPT? 
- 2. Can we forecast whether a developer will incorporate the code in a production 
environment by analyzing their interactions with ChatGPT during a conversation?
- 3. How does the quality of answers regenerated by ChatGPT differ from the ones generated 
initially?

##Research Question 1- What types of quality issues (for example, as identified by linters) are common in the 
code generated by ChatGPT?

Dataset Used: 20231012_235320_discussion_sharings.json. It containins the prompts and answers generated by chatpt with code snippets.

Code file: Assignment_SE.ipynb

Requirements: Python 3

Overview: This question addresses the types of quality issues common in the code generated by chatgpt by automating the pylint linter on the codes generated by chatgpt.

Code structure: 
1. define quality metrics
2. Select pylint linter
3. Automate the linter to run on the code snippets from the dataset
4. Manual review if threshold>7
5. Linter rating and quality issues analysis



##Research Question 2- Can we forecast whether a developer will incorporate the code in a production 
environment by analyzing their interactions with ChatGPT during a conversation?

Overview:
This repository contains code for predicting whether a developer will incorporate ChatGPT code into a production environment based on their interactions with ChatGPT. The prediction is made using a combination of sentiment analysis, machine learning, and feature engineering.

Requirements: Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, seaborn, matplotlib

Download NLTK data:
python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon

Run the code-Run the code by running all the cells

Research Question 2-Main script containing the code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
prompts_answers.csv: CSV file containing prompts and answers extracted from the dataset.
discussion_sharings.json: JSON file containing data about developer interactions with ChatGPT.

##Research Question 3- How does the quality of answers regenerated by ChatGPT differ from the ones generated 
initially?

Requirements: Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, rouge, scikit-learn, scipy

Dataset: “ChatGPT_Link_Sharing.csv”. It has columns like 'MentionedSource', 'MentionedAuthor', 'Status', and 'URL'.
Code file: 

Features:
Data Visualization: The notebook visualizes data on mentioned sources and authors, as well as the distribution of status codes and URL domains.
Text Similarity Evaluation: It includes code for calculating BLEU and ROUGE scores between sample sentences, showcasing how to evaluate text similarity.
Statistical Testing: Chi-squared tests are performed to understand the relationship between different categorical variables in the dataset.

Code Structure:
Import Libraries: The necessary Python libraries are imported.
Data Loading: The CSV file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Preparation and Plotting: For two separate analyses, the data is prepared and visualized using bar plots.
Text Similarity Evaluation: Demonstration of BLEU and ROUGE score calculations, along with a sample F1 score calculation.
Statistical Testing: Execution of Chi-squared tests on different combinations of dataset columns to extract meaningful insights.
